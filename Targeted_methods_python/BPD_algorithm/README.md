This folder contains the C++ code of the Belief Propagation Decimation algorithm originally proposed in the paper "Identifying optimal targets of network attack by belief propagation" Phys. Rev. E 94, 012305, 2016 (https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.94.012305) by S. Mugisha and H-J. Zhou. The code  was adapted to be compatible with the python interface and considered in the Pareto approach presented in the paper.

The original C++ code developed by H-J. Zhou can be download at this address: http://power.itp.ac.cn/~zhouhj/codes.html 
Please consider citing the paper if you use the original code.
