In the folder, there is a C code that allow to increase (resp. decrease) the structural overlap of a multiplex network. 
The algorithm is based on the procedure described in the paper:

"*Optimal percolation in correlated multilayer networks with overlap*" ArXiv preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.04783

Sample bash scripts to launch the code with different options can be found in the "Example/" directory, where you will find a synthetic multiplex network consisting of two independent realisations of the Erdos-Renyi random graph models with N=1000 nodes and K=3000 links.
